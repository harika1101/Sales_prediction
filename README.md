# Sales_prediction
Sales forecasting is the process of estimating future sales. Accurate sales forecasts enable companies to make informed business decisions and predict short-term and long-term performance. Companies can base their forecasts on past sales data, industry-wide comparisons, and economic trends.  The dataset that we used in this problem is "Advertising" dataset. It consists of five columns, out of which three columns namely TV, radio and newspaper are considered as input data and the last column i.e., sales is considered to be target values.  In this problem, we made use of linear regression to predict the rate of sales.
